# Traffic-Sign-Recognition

This traffic sign recognition project is using classification based Deep 
learning models and transfer learning pretrained models. The best model will help 
us to predict which sign is given to it.
In this Project the requirement to classify an unlabeled given image with
the help of provided model. For that in this project we are going to use different 
technologies. Here is some requirements for this project. 
➢ Model should be exposed through API or User Interface, so that everyone can 
test it 
➢ Model should be deployed (if possible) on cloud (Azure, Heroku, AWS, GCP,)
